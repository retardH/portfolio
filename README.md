# My Portfolio
---
This is my official portfolio website.
I built the website with mainly **ReactJS** and **TailwindCSS** for _styling_.
I also used some other third-party library for the portfolio like **Swiper**.
You can read about me, see my skills there and explore about the projects I've written.
As a junior developer, I still have a lot of skills to develop but I'm improving myself everyday.
You will see a blog section there but I haven't added it yet. But as soon as I've written enough blogs to share
various things I've learnt, I will add a blog-posts section as an addition to my portfolio.
So, It's comming soon.... :wink:
